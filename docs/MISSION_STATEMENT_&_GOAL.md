# Mission and Goal - Sunbelt-PM-System-V1

## Mission Statement

Sunbelt-PM-System is a unified platform that streamlines modular construction workflows across sales, project management/operations, and production at Sunbelt Modular, integrating shared real-time data and advanced analytics—such as efficiency tracking, personnel metrics, and factory dashboards—to eliminate silos, boost company-wide performance, and enable data-driven insights for trends, forecasting, and continuous improvement.

## Goal

The primary goal of Sunbelt-PM-System is to secure company-wide adoption at Sunbelt Modular by demonstrating its transformative potential through a compelling demo to the VP and IT Manager. Developed in secret, the platform will showcase all features and capabilities using relevant data, illustrating how it streamlines project management while complementing Praxis as the anchor for sales estimates—enabling unified data sharing across sales, PM/operations, and production to reduce delays, enhance efficiency tracking (e.g., personnel metrics and factory dashboards), and unlock advanced analytics for trends and forecasting. Success will be measured by securing buy-in for rollout, starting with pilot testing in one factory and expanding to full integration, ultimately driving 20-30% improvements in operational efficiency and decision-making.
